From Curious to Committed

#community #learning #programming #webdev

So the New Year brought some changes and, hopefully, commitments. Obviously, I joined the DEV Community but I also created a new account on freeCodeCamp and started with version 10 of their Curriculum.

Starting at the begining with the Responsive Web Design Certification, I completed Building a Curriculum Online during my first session yesterday:

```html
<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>
<h2>Full Stack Curriculum</h2>
<p>Learn the skills to become a full stack developer</p>

<h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
<p>HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage</p>

<h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
<p>CSS is used to style a webpage</p>

<h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage</p>
```

Determined to continue learning on the platform everyday, this morning saw me tackle Debug Camperbot's Profile Page, the first Lab. This involved correcting all the errors below:

```html
<h1>Hello from Camperbot!</h1>

<heading2>About</heading2>

<pp>My name is Camperbot and I love learning new things.</pp>

<h3>Background and Interests<h3/>
<pp>I enjoy solving puzzles.</pp>
```
I found the Lab to be a nice gentle introduction into debugging code. In fact, the current version of the freeCodeCamp Curriculum makes an excellent entry point into Responsive Web Design.

Next up was some theory with Understanding HTML Attributes, which was followed by another Lab. This format helped strengthen my learning.

I'm very much looking forward to continuing my journey with freeCodeCamp, while using DEV Community to ensure my commitment.
