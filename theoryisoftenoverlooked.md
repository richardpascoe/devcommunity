Theory is often overlooked

One of the many things that I really like about version 10 of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp is the theory exercises. Ever since taking my first steps into webdev some years ago, I've understood what things like UTF-8 do but never looked deeply enough to understand the details. A useful theory lesson via freeCodeCamp made things crystal clear.

Even starting out, most of us quickly understand the advantages of boilerplate code, particularly in regard to web design. Another lesson from yesterday gave me a great boilerplate example, as shown below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
I finished yesterday as I will start my lessons today, building a Cat Photo App. I was pleased to see these series of exercises still in the curriculum, as I think they serve as an ideal yet fun introduction to web development.
