Hello World!

#community #learning #programming  #webdev

Hello to the DEV Community! For five years now I have played around with Python, while also taking an interest in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The coming of the New Year has meant I have looked at my progress and decided that if I truly wanted to improve my skills further, I would have to become more focused and improve my commitment levels. 

I have always enjoyed using Python, since my first experience of it during lockdown. An interest in Web Development followed, surrounding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Python programming language will remain my first love, however, and I hope to truly improve my understanding of it during 2026.

With all this in mind, I signed-up for freeCodeCamp today. I've started with the Responsive Web Design Certification but am also very much looking forward to their Python Certification later on.

In closing, I hope you all join me on my learning journey!
